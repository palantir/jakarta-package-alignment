    fix issue with getReplacement when version is empty string

    It is possible that JakartaPackageAlignmentPlugin will call getReplacement with an empty string for the version. Previously, this code would erroneously return a replacement version because the comparator for ComparableVersion returns -1 when an empty string is compared with the maximum Jakarta version.

    To address that, only look for a replacement when the version is non-null and non-empty.

    Fixes #25
